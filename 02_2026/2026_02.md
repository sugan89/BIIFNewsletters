BIIF contributed to a machine learning framework, differentiating microrheological features of native and artificial colonic mucus, identifying hydroxyethyl cellulose–based artificial mucus as the best mimic of native mucus. We provided an advanced image analysis pipeline to isolate and track nano- and micro-scale particles in complex mucus backgrounds and generated quantitative particle trajectory data that powered the machine learning analysis. 

# NBIS workshop
